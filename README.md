## My process

I started br creating the html structure and from there i added the various text and images. know, i added the css the by step starting from he top going down bottom.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

```css 
ol li::marker {
      color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
      font-weight: bold; /* Optional: make the numbers bold */
    }
ul li::marker{
      color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
      font-weight: bold;
    }
td, th {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;
  text-align: left;
  padding: 8px;
    }
td:first-child {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### Continued development

i'll try to learn how to identify specific eleents in a css like rows or columns of tables

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://chatgpt.com) - This helped me:
  -learn how to style the css for the unordered and ordered list
  -learn how to  tag specific elements in the html part 
  -how to set ub bottom borders in some parts
  
for these reasons. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
